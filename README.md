PYTHON PROGRAMMING COURSE  PROJECTS

Overview:This repository is a collection of Python projects and exercis    es that I completed as part of my Python programming course. The pro    jects demonstrate fundamental and advanced concepts in Python, cover    ing topics such asdata structures, algorithms, object-oriented prog    ramming (OOP), file handling, and more.

Features:
Clean and well-documented Python code
Multiple projects showcasing different Python concepts
Examples of using libraries like `panda`, and `matplotlibI.
Exercises for beginners and advanced Python learners

  TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS USED
During this my learning phase, i worked with the following technologies and tools:
1. Python, version 3.x
2. VS Code Editor; Used as the primary development environment for writing and testing Python code.
3. Google colab/Jupyter Notebook: For running my Python code interactively, especially for data analysis.
4. Libraries like
     Matplotlib: For visualizing data through charts and graphs.
     Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis, particularly with DataFrames.
5. Android applications like Termux and Pycode
